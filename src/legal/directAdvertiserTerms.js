        (these&nbsp;&ldquo;Terms and Conditions&rdquo;&nbsp;and together with

        the&nbsp;&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) are entered into by and between
        Reverse Media LLP, a New Delhi, India based LLP company
        (&ldquo;StreamPala&rdquo;) and the undersigned entity
        (&ldquo;Client&rdquo;).

        From time to time, the parties may mutually agree on insertion orders
        (&ldquo;Insertion Orders&rdquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&ldquo;IOs&rdquo;) under
        which StreamPala will deliver advertisements or other content provided
        by Client (&ldquo;Client Ads&rdquo;) on websites or other properties
        (including www.StreamPala.com) operated by or on behalf of StreamPala or
        its affiliates, including through any media, devices or networks now
        known or hereafter developed (the&nbsp;&ldquo;Service&rdquo;). Each IO
        will specify: (a) where on the Service the Client Ads will be delivered;
        (b) the amount and type of advertising inventory on the Service being
        purchased (e.g., impressions, views, clicks, duration or other desired
        actions or metrics with respect to Client Ads)
        (the&nbsp;&ldquo;Deliverables&rdquo;); (c) the fees and rates applicable
        to the Deliverables; (d) the maximum amount of money to be spent
        pursuant to the IO (if applicable); (e) the start and end dates of the
        applicable Client Ad campaign; and (f) the identity of and contact
        information of any third party tracking mechanism (&ldquo;3rd Party
        Client Ad Server&rdquo;) if applicable. Client may not use 3rd Party
        Client Ad Servers unless specified in the IO and then only in accordance
        with StreamPala&rsquo;s then-current policies for 3rd Party Client Ad
        Servers. StreamPala will use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere
        to frequency caps specified on an IO. Except as otherwise specified in
        this&nbsp;Section 1.1, StreamPala will not be bound by conditions or
        instructions printed or appearing on IO forms submitted by or on behalf
        of Client, and in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any
        IO and these Terms and Conditions, these Terms and Conditions will
        control, except to the extent such IO expressly supersedes or amends a
        specifically referenced section of these Terms and Conditions.

            StreamPala&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement, (iii) negotiate
            any terms or conditions related to the Service which are
            inconsistent with this Agreement, or (iv) engage in any telesales or

        Upon StreamPala&rsquo;s request, Client will immediately deliver to
        StreamPala each applicable Advertiser Agreement. If Client&rsquo;s
        relationship with an Advertiser terminates, Client agrees that
        StreamPala may contract directly with such Advertiser to allow such
        Advertiser to continue to place Client Ads on the Service and obtain
        information related to Client Ads run on its behalf, including account
        and performance history, and that Client shall no longer have access to

        Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, any acts or

        defend, and hold StreamPala harmless from and against all damages,
        liabilities, costs, and expenses that StreamPala may incur as the result
        of such violation. However, Client acknowledges that StreamPala may,
        but, shall in no event be obligated to, directly contact any Advertiser
        and directly enforce the terms of such Advertiser Agreement, including
        if StreamPala has not received payment for such Advertiser&rsquo;s
        account within 14 days from the date of the applicable payment due date.

        Subject to the terms of this Agreement, StreamPala will deliver Client
        Ads in accordance with the terms of the applicable IO. To the extent
        that the size, placement, positioning or any other aspects of the
        presentation of any Client Ads are not specified in an IO, StreamPala
        may determine any of the foregoing in its sole discretion. For Client
        Ads where Deliverables consist of placement for a specified period of
        time, StreamPala may deliver such Deliverables as continuous placements
        for that period, or some other equivalent combination of duration and
        rotation (e.g., 1 week of persistent placement = 2 weeks of 50% rotation
        placements). Scheduling of delivery of any Client Ads is subject to
        availability and may not be continuous. StreamPala will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to notify Client in advance of any inability to
        deliver Client Ads in accordance with the terms of the applicable IO.

        As described in&nbsp;Section 1.2, an IO may only be amended by signed,
        written agreement of Client and StreamPala; provided, however, that
        StreamPala may, in its sole discretion, accept a written request from
        Client to change the following provisions of an IO without a formal
        amendment of the IO: (a) a reallocation of placements between types of
        advertising Deliverables, (b) a change to delivery dates of specific
        lines of Deliverables on the IO, and (c) a change in targeting (each of
        the foregoing, a &ldquo;Limited Change&rdquo;). Client shall submit
        Limited Change requests by email. If StreamPala agrees to such Limited
        Change, StreamPala may indicate such agreement by implementing such
        Limited Change without further confirmation. StreamPala may also propose
        a Limited Change to maximize performance of a particular Client Ad
        campaign, but will not implement such Limited Change without email
        confirmation from Client. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
        this&nbsp;Section 3.2, in no event shall a change to the overall start
        or end date of a Client Ad campaign or the total spend amount under a
        Client Ad campaign be deemed a Limited Change and shall only be
        accomplished through signed written amendment of the IO between Client
        and StreamPala.

        Within 5 days of the effective date of an IO, StreamPala shall make
        available the applicable StreamPala technical specifications for such
        Client Ads (&ldquo;StreamPala Technical Specifications&rdquo;). Client

        Client of any such modifications. If Client is unable to comply with any
        such modified StreamPala Technical Specifications, Client may, as its
        sole and exclusive remedy, either: (a) suspend delivery of any affected
        Client Ads for a reasonable time in order to send compliant Client Ads
        to StreamPala (in which event the end date for any campaign involving
        suspended Client Ads will be extended by a period equal to the period of

        All content for Client Ads must be in compliance with the then-current

        StreamPala policies, including editorial, advertising, privacy, user
        experience, publicity and branding policies (collectively, the
        &ldquo;StreamPala Guidelines&rdquo;). Each of the StreamPala Guidelines
        is hereby incorporated by this reference. All content for Client Ads
        must be received at least 5 days in advance of the earliest Flight Date
        for any Deliverable on the applicable IO. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        in the event StreamPala has agreed to optimize the creative for any
        Client Ad (&ldquo;Ad Optimization&rdquo;), then Client will submit the
        necessary materials at least 5 days prior to the estimated flight dates
        for such optimization (as specified by StreamPala). Client agrees that
        in connection with such Ad Optimization, StreamPala may (a) rearrange
        Client- provided materials to create different versions of Client Ads,
        and (b) pause, reschedule or cancel delivery of impressions that are
        part of an Ad Optimization at any time. Changes to Client Ad content for
        text or standard graphical Client Ads must be received by StreamPala at
        least 3 days in advance of requested change date; changes to content for
        all other Client Ads must be received by StreamPala at least 5 days in
        advance of requested change date. StreamPala will not be required to
        accept changes to Client Ad content more than once in any rolling 7 day
        period. Client shall not be relieved of its payment obligations under an
        IO for Client Ads not delivered due to delays by Client in delivery of
        Client Ads to StreamPala. Client will be solely responsible for all fees
        associated with serving any &ldquo;rich media&rdquo; Client Ads.

        For any contest, sweepstakes, coupon or other promotion to be offered or

        (&ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;), Client (or a third party contracted by Client

        No approval by or assistance from StreamPala in connection with a
        Promotion (including as may be specified in an IO or elsewhere) shall
        reduce or satisfy the Promotional Obligations, and Client shall remain
        solely responsible for the Promotion Obligations. Without limiting the
        foregoing, StreamPala&rsquo;s review or approval of the official rules,
        offer terms or regulations for any Promotion shall not constitute a
        legal opinion as to the legal appropriateness, accuracy or adequacy of
        those rules or their manner of use, nor a waiver of StreamPala&rsquo;s
        indemnity rights under this Agreement.

        In the event Client purchases or utilizes StreamPala for a sampling
        engagement exercise (&ldquo;Sampling Engagement&rdquo;) to offer samples
        or giveaways of Products (&ldquo;Offer(s)&rdquo;), Client will be solely
        responsible for honoring and fulfilling all Offers accepted by users up
        to the maximum quantity identified on the applicable IO or, if a maximum
        quantity has not been identified on the applicable IO, all Offers
        accepted by users. As used herein, &ldquo;Product(s)&rdquo; means a
        product, item, or service of Client. StreamPala will provide Client with
        the contact information of each user that accepts the Offer
        (&ldquo;Contact Information&rdquo;). At no cost to StreamPala or users
        (directly or indirectly), Client will provide each such user with the
        applicable Product within thirty (30) days of the date on which Client
        receives the user&rsquo;s Contact Information from StreamPala. As
        between the parties, Contact Information is the property of StreamPala,
        and StreamPala owns all right, title and interest in and to Contact
        Information. Client may use Contact Information solely for the purposes
        of fulfilling the applicable Offer in accordance with this Section 3.6.
        Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall: (i) keep Contact
        Information confidential; (ii) subject to the other conditions of this
        Section, handle Contact Information in accordance with all applicable
        privacy laws; (iii) not use Contact Information to contact or
        communicate with any user (except to fulfill Offers in accordance with
        this Section 3.6); (iv) not sell, rent, lease or otherwise disclose
        Contact Information to any third party; and (v) delete Contact
        Information from its system and destroy all copies of Contact
        Information once the applicable Offer has been fulfilled. StreamPala is
        not responsible for any incomplete or inaccurate Contact Information.
        All Offers and Products are subject to StreamPala&rsquo;s prior written
        approval, and only those Offers and Products that have been pre-approved
        by StreamPala in writing may be offered to users. Products offered may
        not be substituted. Receipt by users of Products will not be conditioned
        on the payment of any fees (including, without limitation, shipping and
        handling fees) or taxes or the completion of any requirements (other
        than the provision of Contact Information to StreamPala), and Client is
        responsible for payment of all fees and taxes in relation to the Product
        including, without limitation, shipping, delivery and importation.
        Without limiting the foregoing, Client will clearly and conspicuously
        disclose to users all terms, conditions and restrictions that are
        applicable to use of Products in accordance with applicable law but such
        terms, conditions and restrictions must not conflict with this Section
        and must not prevent use of the Product in a manner which a user would
        reasonably be expected to be able to use the Product based on the Offer.
        In no event will use by users of Products be subject to any recurring or
        automatic subscriptions or the payment of any fees or taxes. Client
        shall ensure that the Offer and Product is age appropriate for eligible
        users. StreamPala makes no guarantees or commitments with respect to the
        number of Offers accepted. Client will ensure that the Offer, Product
        and delivery of the Product complies with any and all applicable laws,
        rules and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall
        disclose within the Offer all information about Client&rsquo;s identity
        as required by and in accordance with applicable law. No approval by or
        assistance from StreamPala in connection with an Offer (including as may
        be specified in an IO or elsewhere) shall reduce or satisfy the
        obligations of Client in relation to the Offer. Client shall ensure that
        all representations made in relation to the Product or Offer are
        accurate and must not make any false or misleading or deceptive
        statements. Without limiting the foregoing, StreamPala&rsquo;s review or
        approval of Products, the Offer, or the Offer terms, conditions, or
        restrictions shall not constitute a legal opinion as to the legal
        appropriateness, accuracy or adequacy of the Products, the Offer, or the

        Client Ads after the term of the IO if the IO has been terminated by
        reason of Client&rsquo;s breach pursuant to&nbsp;Section 5. StreamPala
        will not be required to remedy under-deliveries due to delays caused by
        Client. Client understands that all discounts are based on
        Client&rsquo;s commitment to fulfilling the discount criteria indicated
        in the IO. If, for any reason, these criteria are not satisfied at the
        expiration or cancellation of the IO, Client will pay a short rate
        charge on all Client Ads run equal to the difference between the rate
        shown in the IO and the rate earned based on the applicable rate card
        without consideration of any discounts.

        Any initial payment specified in any IO will be due and payable upon the
        effective date of such IO. For subsequent payments specified in any IO,
        unless otherwise specified in such IO, StreamPala will invoice Client,
        at the address specified in the IO, based upon the calendar month in
        which activity occurred. Invoiced amounts will be due and payable
        fourteen (14) days after StreamPala&rsquo;s delivery of the applicable
        invoice. Invoiced amounts and all other amounts payable by Client to
        StreamPala are exclusive of any applicable tax, duty, levy, or other
        governmental charge, including but not limited to GST, sales, use,
        value-added, withholding, and excise taxes (&ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;). Client
        is responsible for payment of all Taxes to the proper taxing or
        governmental authority. Interest will accrue on any past due amounts at
        the rate of the lesser of 2% per month or the lawful maximum. If
        Client&rsquo;s payment method fails or Client&rsquo;s account is past
        due, StreamPala may collect past due amounts using other collection
        mechanisms, and Client agrees to pay all expenses associated with such
        collection, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. If Client pays
        any amounts due with a credit card and the issuer of the credit card
        seeks to recover from StreamPala any amounts received by StreamPala from
        the issuer, Client will immediately remit to StreamPala all amounts
        necessary to comply with the issuer&apos;s request and any costs and
        expenses incurred by StreamPala in connection therewith.

        Within 2 business days of the effective date of any IO, StreamPala will
        notify Client (either electronically or in writing) as to whether the
        Client Ads specified in the IO have begun delivery. Thereafter,
        StreamPala will: (a) if so requested by Client in writing, make
        available to Client weekly interim reports (&ldquo;Interim
        Reports&rdquo;) setting forth StreamPala&rsquo;s then-current
        calculation of the Deliverables delivered during the period covered by
        the report and the anticipated payments due therefor; and (b) include
        with each invoice delivered pursuant to&nbsp;Section 4.1&nbsp;a report
        (a&nbsp;&ldquo;Monthly Report&rdquo;) setting forth StreamPala&rsquo;s
        final calculation of the Deliverables delivered during the period
        covered by the invoice and the payments due therefor. All payments due

            other nature) to the other party (&ldquo;Recipient&rdquo;) that has

            information and/or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure,
            should reasonably be considered confidential. Without limiting the

            StreamPala technical specifications, Contact Information,
            information relating to Deliverables, and any information relating
            to StreamPala products. Recipient shall maintain in confidence

            other remedies available to it) to remedy any threatened or actual
            breach of Section 9 by Recipient without the necessity of posting

        Excluding payment obligations, neither party will be liable for any
        delay or default in the performance of its obligations if such delay or

        (collectively,&nbsp;&ldquo;Force Majeure&rdquo;). If performance is

        non-delayed party will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by

        Except as specifically provided herein, if any portion of this Agreement
        is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in
        full force and effect and the court will construe any invalid or
        unenforceable portions in a manner that most closely reflects the effect
        and intent of the original language. If such construction is not
        possible, the provision will be severed from this Agreement and the rest
        of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure by
        either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way
        be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in
        any way affect the right of such party to enforce such provision
        thereafter. Client may not assign or otherwise transfer (including by
        any reorganization, change of control, merger, acquisition or sale or
        transfer of all or part of its assets or business) Client&rsquo;s rights
        or obligations under this Agreement including any IO without the prior
        written permission of StreamPala, and in no event will StreamPala be
        obligated to serve Client Ads for any third party. StreamPala may freely
        assign or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations under this
        Agreement including any IO, in whole or in part. Any purported
        assignment or other transfer in violation of this provision shall be
        null and void. This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the
        benefit of the parties and their permitted respective successors and
        assigns. Each of StreamPala&rsquo;s affiliates are express and intended
        third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may enforce any of its
        terms and exercise any of the rights to the same extent as StreamPala.

        Agreement is intended to or does create any type of joint venture,
        partnership or employer/employee relationship between Client and
