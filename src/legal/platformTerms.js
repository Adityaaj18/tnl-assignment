        STREAMPALA SELF-SERVE AD PLATFORM TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ADVERTISERS

      </p>
      <p>
        The following terms (&quot;Self-serve Advertising Terms&quot; or
        &quot;Self-serve Ad Terms&quot;) apply to your use
        of&nbsp;StreamPala&rsquo;s&nbsp;advertising service (self-service
        advertising interfaces and APIs) for creation, submission and/or
        delivery of any advertising or other commercial or sponsored activity or
        content (collectively, &quot;Self-serve Ad Interfaces&quot;) and any
        order you place through the Self-serve Ad Interfaces
        (&quot;Order&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can target your audience by buying ads to be delivered on the
        content of StreamPala&rsquo;s partner creators on a third-party platform
        such as YouTube, StreamPala, Instagram, Twitch, Tik Tok, LinkedIn, our
        publisher network or any place where we serve ads.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you place an Order, you will tell us the type of advertising
            you want to buy, the amount you want to spend and your bid. If we
            accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as inventory becomes
            available. When serving your ad, we use our best efforts to deliver
            the ads through the network you specify or to achieve the outcome
            you select, although we cannot guarantee in every instance that your
            ad will reach its intended target or achieve the outcome you select.

            Your ads must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
            guidelines, as well as our&nbsp;Advertising Policies.&nbsp;Failure
            to comply may result in a variety of consequences, including the
            cancellation of ads that you have placed and termination of your
            account.

            <li>
              <p>
                We use a third-party payment gateway to enable transactions on
                our platform. Usage of the platform is subject to Terms and
                Conditions mentioned on the transaction page of the third party
                gateway.

            <li>
              <p>
                You will pay all amounts specified in each Order you place,
                along with any applicable taxes. The amount you owe for each
                Order will be calculated based on our tracking mechanisms.

            <li>
              <p>
                By placing an Order, you authorise us to obtain your personal
                and/or business credit report from a credit bureau, either when
                you place an Order or at any time thereafter.

            <li>
              <p>
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
                advertising account, and you understand that you will be charged
                for any Orders placed on or through your advertising account.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you are making direct debit payments, you agree that we can
                charge you any amount that falls within the range that you
                agreed to upon sign-up. We will notify you in advance if any
                charge will exceed the agreed-upon range.

            <li>
              <p>
                You can cancel an Order at any time, but your ads may run for 24
                hours after you notify us, and you are still responsible for
                paying for all ads that run.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The amounts that we charge you may be subject to and include
                applicable taxes and levies, including without limitation
                withholding taxes. You are responsible for bearing and remitting
                any taxes that apply to your transactions. You will indemnify
                and hold us harmless from and against any claim arising out of
                your failure to do so.

            <li>
              <p>
                If your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may
                take additional steps to collect past due amounts. You will pay
                all expenses associated with such collection, including
                reasonable legal fees. Past due amounts will accrue interest at
                1% per month or the lawful maximum, whichever is less.

              <p>
                You will fall under one of two categories depending on your
                payment method: invoiced or non-invoiced client. Invoiced
                clients are those for whom StreamPala sets a maximum spending
                limit and issues invoices on a periodic basis for payment in
                accordance with the applicable invoicing terms. Non-invoiced
                clients are those who must make payments at the time of purchase
                itself. In its sole discretion, StreamPala may classify clients
                as invoiced clients based on factors such as ad spend and
                creditworthiness.

            From time to time, we need to test improvements to our audiences and

            is designed to improve the effectiveness of your advertising
            performance. We reserve the right to test when we believe it will be
            beneficial for advertiser performance.

            in place that attempt to detect and filter certain click activity,

                (including from the creator content running the ads). If our
                partner creators (&lsquo;users&rdquo;) have interacted with your
                ad, your ad may remain on their content (e.g. shared until the
