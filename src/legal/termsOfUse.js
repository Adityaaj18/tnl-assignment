            The subject of the Contract is the paid provision by the Creator to
            StreamPala with the option to display or embed advertising content
            on the content, channel, website or subpage managed by the Creator.
            This means that the Creator provides Internet media, for a specified
            period of time, to post and maintain contents received from
            StreamPala at a specified internet address (lease/rental of
            advertising space on the content, channel, website or subpage
            managed by the Creator).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Access to the advertising space is provided for the time specified
            by the Creator in their account and accepted by StreamPala. At the
            same time:

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

        <li>
          <p>
            StreamPala may (without justification, temporarily or permanently,
            without the Creator&apos;s right to compensation) refuse to allow
            the use of advertising space, and such action shall not violate
            StreamPala&apos;s obligations, which the Creator acknowledges and
            accepts.

        <li>
          <p>
            The contract is entered into electronically, by creating an account
            and submitting a declaration by the Creator (via the form provided
            by StreamPala) regarding the acceptance of the Terms and Conditions.
            Creating an account may additionally require confirmation of data
            (authentication) via an external service (e.g. Google or YouTube).
            The Contract is entered into the moment StreamPala sends an email
            confirming the creation of the account (data transfer from the
            sender&apos;s server). A traditional hand-signature from the Creator
            is not required to conclude the Contract.

            StreamPala aims to maximally simplify the formalities in relations
            with the Creators. In some cases, StreamPala may, however, require
            additional authentication from Creators before or after entering
            into the contract. In particular, StreamPala may request that the
            Creator submit:
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A valid proof from the Registrar of Companies (in case the Creator
            operates as a legally registered business entity or in the case of a
            registered sole proprietorship run by the Creator), or excerpt from
            a government verified source such as a National Court Register or
            similar register proper for the Creator&apos;s country (in the case
            of a Creator being a legal person or an organisational unit without
            legal personality)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            submit for inspection and allow for a copy of identity card or
            another identity document be made in the case of a Creator being a
            natural person or in the case of natural persons acting for the
            Creator;

            StreamPala may be obliged to tax the Creator&rsquo;s revenues in
            India and, therefore, StreamPala requires that the Creators residing
            outside India should present tax residence certificates. One can
            cooperate with StreamPala without providing the certificate, but in
            such case StreamPala may withhold a partial or full payment gained
            by the Creator until the certificate is provided. The remuneration
            is withheld for the purposes of tax settlements with the appropriate
            Indian tax authority. The Creator is not entitled to charge interest
            on the withheld remuneration.
