            These Advertising Policies provide guidance on what types of ad
            content are allowed. When advertisers place an order, each ad is
            reviewed against these policies. If you think your ad was mistakenly
            disapproved, you can request a review of the decision by contacting
            us at&nbsp;

      <p>
        StreamPala requires its creator network (&ldquo;users&rdquo;) to exhibit
        ads through the users&rsquo; content on their social media channel(s).
        These social media channels reside on third party platforms that may
        have their own, individual content policies. To protect interest of our
        users&rsquo; channels and their participation on these social media
        platforms, all ads on StreamPala must conform to the content standards
        on partner creator&rsquo;s platform.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        A preview of the ad will be showcased to the StreamPala users upon
        selection, and only they reserve the right to accept or reject to
        participate in the ad campaign in order to safeguard their interests.

          <p>Ad Review:</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Our ad review system makes use of automated tools to check ads against
        these advertising policies.&nbsp;This typically happens before the
        campaign begins running. Additionally, ads may be reviewed again,
        including after they are live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should your ad content be flagged as inappropriate, or, if we believe it
        endangers our partner creator channels as per Clause 2. of this
        document, we shall pause your campaign and endeavor to inform you about
        the same.&nbsp;

        You may request a review of our decision by emailing us at&nbsp;

        edit the existing campaign to modify the creative, or, set up a new

                Once displayed, ads are public information. Ads may be reshared

                creator&rsquo;s channels on third party social media products
                (for example, shared until the users delete it or visible to
                users through their account tools). Reverse Media LLP may
                disclose your advertising content, and all information
                associated with your advertising, to a governmental entity or
                body if Reverse Media LLP believes that disclosure would assist
                in a lawful investigation.

                associated with an established ad account; set up a new account.
                You are responsible for ensuring that each advertiser complies
